# Mirai - Stream Anime / Read Manga

A fork of ProjectSakura/Mirai, meant to go serverless.
Using public sources for fetching data. This solves dependency on heroku

**Website Link**: https://mirai-projectsakura.herokuapp.com/

## Deployment

You can try the original repo's deployment available at `https://mirai-projectsakura.herokuapp.com/`, but that is severely limited, in number of calls allowed, but enough to try

Or deploy your own version ->

#### Status

A lot of work to be done left to port... also some changes like not directly manupulating the DOM
